# Wyoming server settings (connects to Home Assistant)
# This makes RPi act as a satellite - it detects wake word and records audio,
# then sends it to HA for STT processing. HA sends back TTS audio to play.

# The satellite will connect to HA's Wyoming server
# Configure this in HA: Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Wyoming Protocol
